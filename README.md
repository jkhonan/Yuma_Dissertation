PROJECT GOALS
The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the potential health risks of exposure to certain environmental chemicals, including metals, pesticides, and salts, through inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact. These contaminants have been detected in air, water, and soil in Yuma County, Arizona, mainly due to industrial and agricultural operations in the area. Using epidemiological and statistical modeling techniques, we completed an assessment of ecological impact and human health to shed light on the impact these toxicants can have on border communities. Ultimately, these analyses will guide translational research methods that can be used to suggest implementable practices that are more protective of human health by minimizing unacceptable exposures for workers and residents. 

RESEARCH PLAN
For this research, we used multivariate statistical modeling to evaluate the associations between contaminant concentrations and health outcomes, with the goal of describing population-level health impacts from aggregate exposures. Primary outcome variables of interest for the analysis of perchlorate exposures include hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer, goiter, obesity, and other reproductive disorders. Previous studies have shown that exposure to perchlorate can affect iodine uptake by the endocrine system, leading to increased risk for these outcomes. Prior research has shown elevated risk of adverse health outcomes for those exposed to increased concentrations of metals, although additional studies considering these associations will be beneficial. 

Data for this analysis have been previously collected for metal concentrations in hair, perchlorate concentrations in urine, and hormone levels representing endocrine function in blood. Longitudinal concentrations for a similar sample population are also accessible for perchlorates in urine. Models will be developed to determine if relationships exist between the exposure levels and the health effects. Models will be adjusted to account for mediating, moderating, and confounding variables as necessary, including conditions of residency, socioeconomic status (SES), and other demographic characteristics. A robust principal component analysis (PCA) will be used to better control for outliers in skewed datasets, as are commonly found in biological samples.

PROJECT AIMS
Model relationships between concentrations of metals (Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, and U) measured in hair samples and demographic factors that may be related to concentration levels. Model relationships between urinary perchlorate and thyroid outcomes.
